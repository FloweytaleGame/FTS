# FTS/FTSLib 0.1.1

A simple C++ library for decoding FTS (FloweyTaleSave) files.


## Documentation

All [documentation](https://FloweytaleGame.github.io/fts/html) is available here: https://FloweytaleGame.github.io/fts/html

Here, the documentation is all for the C++ core library, but any function and functioning is appliable with any binding.


## Installation

### Bindings

At the moment, they are not made yet, but will be on Godot planned for 0.1.2 (coming very shortly!), and will be usable as an addon.

### Using pre-compiled binaries (for now, only compiled on Windows)

Go into the "bin" folder, click on "FTSLib.dll", and click on the download icon.

### Compiling a binary (script only made for Windows)

Clone the project:
```
git clone https://github.com/FloweytaleGame/FTS.git
```

and simply run the premade batch script:
```
./build-binaries.bat
```

### Compiling a binary (not on Windows)

Premade scripts are not made for other platforms other than on Windows for the moment (feel free to contribute any!), but simply take the g++ command from the "build-binaries.bat" file - you can use this as a base, but feel free to write any other command with the compiler of your choice -, and modify it to your needs!
